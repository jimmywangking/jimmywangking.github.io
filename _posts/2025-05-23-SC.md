### A1: Arithmetic
# Bandwidth Allocation Solution

To solve this problem, we need to allocate bandwidth units among `n` API endpoints such that:
1. No two adjacent endpoints have bandwidth allocations differing by more than 1 unit
2. Every endpoint gets at least 1 unit of bandwidth
3. We need to maximize the allocation to the `k`-th endpoint

## Approach
1. **Understand the constraints**: The key constraint is that adjacent endpoints can't differ by more than 1 unit. This creates a "pyramid" pattern where bandwidth increases towards the center and decreases towards the ends.

2. **Pattern recognition**: The maximum allocation to any endpoint `k` depends on its position relative to the ends of the sequence. The optimal allocation forms a pyramid with peak at `k`.

3. **Mathematical formulation**: We can model this as finding the peak of a pyramid centered at `k`, while ensuring the total bandwidth sums to `m`.

## Solution Code

```java
public class BandwidthAllocation {
    public static int findMaximumBandwidth(int n, int k, int m) {
        // The minimal possible sum is n (1 unit per endpoint)
        if (m < n) {
            return -1; // Not possible to allocate
        }
        
        // Binary search to find the maximum possible x for endpoint k
        int left = 1;
        int right = m;
        int result = 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            // Calculate minimum bandwidth needed if endpoint k gets 'mid' units
            long minSum = calculateMinSum(n, k, mid);
            
            if (minSum <= m) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private static long calculateMinSum(int n, int k, int x) {
        // Calculate the sum when endpoint k gets x units
        // Left side: forms a pyramid up to k
        long leftSum = 0;
        // From 1 to k: x, x-1, ..., x - (k-1)
        // But can't go below 1
        int leftPeak = Math.min(k, x);
        leftSum = (long)leftPeak * (leftPeak + 1) / 2;
        if (x > k) {
            leftSum += (long)(x - k) * k;
        }
        
        // Right side: forms a pyramid down from k
        long rightSum = 0;
        // From k to n: x, x-1, ..., x - (n - k)
        // But can't go below 1
        int rightPeak = Math.min(n - k + 1, x);
        rightSum = (long)rightPeak * (rightPeak + 1) / 2;
        if (x > (n - k + 1)) {
            rightSum += (long)(x - (n - k + 1)) * (n - k + 1);
        }
        
        // Subtract x once since it was counted in both left and right sums
        return leftSum + rightSum - x;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample test case
        System.out.println(findMaximumBandwidth(4, 3, 17)); // Output: 5
        System.out.println(findMaximumBandwidth(6, 2, 11)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to find the maximum possible bandwidth `x` that can be allocated to endpoint `k`. For each candidate `x`, we calculate the minimum total bandwidth needed to satisfy the constraints.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The `calculateMinSum` function computes the minimal bandwidth distribution where:
   - The left side of `k` forms an increasing sequence (1, 2, ..., x)
   - The right side of `k` forms a decreasing sequence (x, x-1, ..., 1)
   - The sum is adjusted to ensure no endpoint gets less than 1 unit

3. **Edge Handling**: We ensure the pyramid doesn't go below 1 unit for endpoints at the far ends, and properly account for cases where `x` is larger than the distance to either end.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum possible allocation for endpoint `k` while respecting all constraints, using binary search to optimize the solution.

### Q2: DB
2. Are you an expert on data structures?
Which of the following data structures can erase from its beginning or its end in O(1) tim
Pick ONE option
vector
deque
stack
segment tree

### A2: 
The correct answer is: **deque** (Double-Ended Queue)

Here's why:

1. **deque** (Double-Ended Queue):
   - Can erase/pop from both front and back in O(1) time
   - Implemented as a dynamic array that grows in both directions
   - Provides constant time insertion/removal at both ends

2. Why not the others:
   - **vector**: Only O(1) erase from back (pop_back), but O(n) from front (requires shifting elements)
   - **stack**: Only allows O(1) operations at one end (LIFO principle)
   - **segment tree**: Designed for range queries, not efficient for end operations

Key characteristics of deque:
- Supports push_front/pop_front and push_back/pop_back in O(1)
- Random access is possible (though not O(1) in all implementations)
- Typically implemented with multiple fixed-size arrays or a circular buffer

This makes deque the ideal choice when you need efficient insertion/removal at both ends of a sequence.

### Q3: SQL
1. Count the Employees
The data for the number employed at several famous IT companies is maintained in the COMPANY table. Write a qi
print the IDs of the companies that have more than 10000 employees, in ascending order of ID.
Input Format
COMPANY
Name
TD
NAME
EMPLOYEES
Type
Integer
String
Integer
Description
A company ID in the inclusive range [1. 1000]. This is the primary key.
A company name. This field contains between 7 and 100 characters (inclusive).
The total number of employees in the company.
Output Format
The result should contain the IDs of all the companies that have more than 10000 employees, in ascending order in tr
following format:
COMPANY. ID
Sample Input
ID
COMPANY
NAME
Adobe
Flipkart
amazor
Paytm
BookMyShow
EMPLOYEES
28085
35543
1089
9982
5589

### A3:
# SQL Query to Count Employees

To solve this problem, I'll write a SQL query that:
1. Selects company IDs from the COMPANY table
2. Filters for companies with more than 10,000 employees
3. Orders the results by ID in ascending order

## Solution

```sql
SELECT ID
FROM COMPANY
WHERE EMPLOYEES > 10000
ORDER BY ID ASC;
```

## Explanation

1. **SELECT ID**: We only need to return the company IDs as specified in the output format
2. **FROM COMPANY**: Querying the COMPANY table where the data is stored
3. **WHERE EMPLOYEES > 10000**: Filter condition to only include companies with more than 10,000 employees
4. **ORDER BY ID ASC**: Ensures the results are sorted in ascending order by company ID

## Expected Output

For the sample input provided, the query would return:
```
ID
1
2
```

This is because:
- Adobe (ID 1) has 28,085 employees (>10,000)
- Flipkart (ID 2) has 35,543 employees (>10,000)
- The other companies have fewer than 10,000 employees and are excluded
- The results are ordered by ID in ascending order as required

### Q4: Arithmetic
3. FizzBuzz

### A4:
# FizzBuzz Solution in Java

Here's the Java implementation for the classic FizzBuzz problem:

## Solution Code

```java
public class FizzBuzz {
    public static void fizzBuzz(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
            } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Fizz");
            } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Buzz");
            } else {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Test with sample input */
        fizzBuzz(15);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Loop through numbers**: We iterate from 1 to n (inclusive)
2. **Check conditions in order**:
   - First check if divisible by both 3 and 5 (print "FizzBuzz")
   - Then check if divisible by 3 only (print "Fizz")
   - Then check if divisible by 5 only (print "Buzz")
   - Finally, print the number if none of the above conditions are met
3. **Order matters**: We check the most specific condition (divisible by both) first, then the individual cases

## Sample Output

For input n = 15, the output would be:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

This solution efficiently handles all cases with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), which is optimal for this problem.


### Q5: security
1. Insecure end point
A local bank recently released a new feature that allow
the mobile application and starts analyzing it. The attacke
eir insurances on a single page. An attacker creates an account with the net banking feature. The attacker cannot find any major security issues on the web, but downlo:
ure and finds an interesting end-point such as tollows:
nttps://api.banking-corp.com/insurance/?id=13066396
The attacker cycles this predictable end-point and is then at
customers data. Which vulnerability is being exploited?
dID
escalalion
1) account takeover
insecure direct obiect referencing
enumeration attack

### A5:
The vulnerability being exploited in this scenario is:

**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**

Here's why:

1. **Predictable endpoint**: The URL contains a direct reference to an insurance record using a simple numeric ID (`?id=13066396`)
2. **Parameter manipulation**: The attacker can cycle through different ID values to access other customers' data
3. **Lack of access control**: The endpoint doesn't verify if the requesting user is authorized to view each specific insurance record
4. **Data exposure**: This allows unauthorized access to sensitive insurance information of other customers

Key characteristics of this vulnerability:
- Direct references to internal implementation objects (like database keys)
- No proper authorization checks
- Predictable patterns in object references
- Bypasses intended access controls

This is different from:
- **Account takeover**: Would require compromising user credentials
- **Enumeration attack**: Typically refers to discovering valid users/IDs, not necessarily accessing their data
- **Privilege escalation**: Would involve elevating user privileges beyond their normal access level

The proper mitigation would be to implement:
1. Proper access control checks
2. Indirect reference maps
3. Session-based authorization
4. Randomized/non-sequential IDs

### Q6: Programming
Local and Global Variable
#L/bin/bash
value-10
funciO)
value=S ((value + 2))
echo "Inside func: Value is: Svalue"
7
func2() f
local value
value=$ ((value + 2))
echo "Inside func2: Value is: Svalue"
1
func Svalue
funca
echo "Outside Function: Value is: Svalue"
What is the output of this Bash script?
Pick ONE option
Inside func1: Value is: 2
Inside func2: Value is: 2
Outside Function: Value is: 10

### A6:
Let's analyze the Bash script step by step to determine the correct output.

### Script Analysis:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
value=10

func1() {
    value=$((value + 2))
    echo "Inside func1: Value is: $value"
}

func2() {
    local value
    value=$((value + 2))
    echo "Inside func2: Value is: $value"
}

func1
func2
echo "Outside Function: Value is: $value"
```

### Execution Flow:
1. **Global variable initialization**: `value=10` (global scope)
2. **func1()**:
   - Modifies the global `value` variable (10 + 2 = 12)
   - Prints: "Inside func1: Value is: 12"
3. **func2()**:
   - Declares a new `local value` variable (shadows the global one)
   - The local `value` is initially empty (treated as 0 in arithmetic)
   - 0 + 2 = 2
   - Prints: "Inside func2: Value is: 2"
   - Doesn't affect the global `value`
4. **Final output**:
   - Global `value` remains 12 (modified by func1)
   - Prints: "Outside Function: Value is: 12"

### Correct Output:
```
Inside func1: Value is: 12
Inside func2: Value is: 2
Outside Function: Value is: 12
```

### Why the Provided Options Are Incorrect:
The option you listed:
```
Inside func1: Value is: 2
Inside func2: Value is: 2
Outside Function: Value is: 10
```
is incorrect because:
1. func1 modifies the global variable (should be 12, not 2)
2. The outside value shows the pre-modified value (should show 12 after func1 modifies it)

### Key Concepts:
- `func1` uses the global variable
- `func2` creates a new local variable (shadowing the global one)
- Local variables don't affect global variables with the same name
- Arithmetic expansion treats empty variables as 0

### Q7:SQL
Which of the following operators is used for pattern matching?
Pick ONE option
(9 15 NULL operator
ASSIGNMENT operator
LIKE operator
NOT operator

### A7:
The correct answer is:

**LIKE operator**

Here's why:

1. **LIKE operator**:
   - Specifically designed for pattern matching in SQL
   - Uses wildcards:
     * `%` - matches any sequence of characters
     * `_` - matches any single character
   - Example: `WHERE name LIKE 'J%'` finds all names starting with 'J'

2. Why not the others:
   - **NULL operator**: Used for checking NULL values (IS NULL, IS NOT NULL)
   - **ASSIGNMENT operator**: Used for assigning values (`=` in most languages)
   - **NOT operator**: Logical operator that reverses a condition

The LIKE operator is the standard SQL operator for pattern matching across all major database systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

### Q8: Arithmetic
Competitive Gaming
A group of friends is playing a video game where players earn points.
At the end of a round, players who achieve at least rank k can "evel
up" their characters. Given the scores of players at the end of the
round, determine how many players will level up.
Notes:
• Players with equal scores share the same rank, and the next player with
a lower score takes the subsequent rank position, For instance, if four
players finish with scores ranking them as 1, 1, 1, and 4, the first three
players tie for first place, and the next player is ranked fourth.
• No player with a score of 0 can level up, regardless of rank.
Example
n = 4
1 = 3
scores = [100, 50. 50. 251
These players' ranks are (1, 2, 2, 41. Because the players need to have
a rank of at least « = 3 to level up, only the first three players quality.
Therefore, the answer is 3.
Function Description
Complete the function numPlayers in the editor with the following
parameters:
int k the cutoff rank to level up a player's character
Int scores[n/ the players' scores
Returns
int: the number of players who can level up after this round
Constraints
• 15 n= 105

### A8:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many players will level up based on their ranks at the end of a round. The key points to consider are:

1. **Ranking Rules**: Players with the same score share the same rank, and the next player with a lower score gets the next subsequent rank. For example, if three players have the same highest score, they all get rank 1, and the next player gets rank 4.
2. **Cutoff Rank**: Only players with a rank of at least `k` can level up.
3. **Zero Score**: Players with a score of 0 cannot level up, regardless of their rank.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Scores**: First, we sort the scores in descending order to easily determine the ranks.
2. **Assign Ranks**: We then assign ranks to each player. Players with the same score will share the same rank. The next player with a lower score will get a rank equal to their position in the sorted list (1-based index).
3. **Count Eligible Players**: We count how many players have a rank ≤ `k` and a score greater than 0.

### Solution Code
```python
def numPlayers(k, scores):
    if not scores:
        return 0
    
    # Sort scores in descending order
    scores.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Assign ranks
    ranks = []
    rank = 1
    for i in range(len(scores)):
        if i == 0:
            ranks.append(rank)
        else:
            if scores[i] == scores[i-1]:
                ranks.append(ranks[i-1])
            else:
                rank = i + 1
                ranks.append(rank)
    
    # Count players who can level up
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(scores)):
        if ranks[i] <= k and scores[i] > 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: The scores are sorted in descending order to facilitate rank assignment. Higher scores come first.
2. **Rank Assignment**: We iterate through the sorted scores. The first player gets rank 1. For subsequent players, if their score is the same as the previous player's score, they receive the same rank. Otherwise, their rank is their 1-based position in the list.
3. **Eligibility Check**: We then count how many players have a rank that is less than or equal to `k` and a score greater than 0. This count is returned as the result.

For example, given the input `k = 3` and `scores = [100, 50, 50, 25]`, the sorted scores are `[100, 50, 50, 25]`. The ranks assigned are `[1, 2, 2, 4]`. The first three players have ranks ≤ 3 and non-zero scores, so the result is 3. This approach efficiently handles the ranking logic and checks the eligibility criteria to determine the number of players who can level up.

### A9:
# SQL Query for Superheroes with Short Names

Here's the SQL query to find superheroes whose names have fewer than 7 characters, sorted by ID in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT NAME
FROM SUPERHERO
WHERE LENGTH(NAME) < 7
ORDER BY ID ASC;
```

## Explanation

1. **SELECT NAME**: We only need to return the superhero names as specified in the output format
2. **FROM SUPERHERO**: Querying the SUPERHERO table where the data is stored
3. **WHERE LENGTH(NAME) < 7**: Filter condition to only include names with fewer than 7 characters
4. **ORDER BY ID ASC**: Ensures the results are sorted in ascending order by superhero ID

## Expected Output

For the sample input provided, the query would return:
```
NAME
batman
```

This is because:
- "batman" has 6 characters (<7)
- "spiderman" has 9 characters (≥7)
- The results are ordered by ID in ascending order as required

The query works across all major SQL databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.


### Q10: Microservice
Microservices Communication
services-based architecture for an e-commerce platform is in the design phase. A core requirement is to ensure that the system can handle eventual consistency while ensuring that the plattorm's various services remain loosely coupled. Two
services. Order Service and Inventory Service, need to communicate regarding the availability of products.
Service needs to check if the product is in stock using the Inventory Service. However, the design must ensure that even it the Inventory service Is tempo
rarily unavailable, the Order Service can still accent
When a customer places an order, the Ordel
orders, albeit with some potential delay in processing.
Which of the following communication patterns is most suitable to
re that the services remain decoupled and the system handles eventual consistency.
PICk ONE OguOn
( Synchronous HTTP REST API calls from Order Service to Inventory Service
O RPC calls from Order Service to Inventory Service using a protocol like gRPC.
Order Service writes to a shared database which Inventory Service polls periodically
Order Service publishes an event (like "OrderPlaced") to a message queue, and Inventory Service subscribes to these

### A10:
The most suitable communication pattern for this scenario is:

**Order Service publishes an event (like "OrderPlaced") to a message queue, and Inventory Service subscribes to these**

Here's why this is the best choice:

1. **Loose Coupling**: 
   - Services communicate via events/messages rather than direct calls
   - Neither service needs to know about the other's implementation

2. **Eventual Consistency**:
   - The order can be accepted immediately
   - Inventory updates can happen when the Inventory Service is available

3. **Resilience**:
   - If Inventory Service is down, messages queue up and process later
   - No blocking of Order Service during inventory checks

4. **Scalability**:
   - Message queues handle load spikes gracefully
   - Each service can scale independently

5. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Matches the business requirement of accepting orders even with delayed processing

The other options have significant drawbacks:
- **Synchronous HTTP/RPC calls**: Create tight coupling and block orders if inventory is down
- **Shared database**: Creates tight coupling and becomes a scalability bottleneck

This event-driven approach with message queues is the standard pattern for handling such scenarios in microservices architectures, providing the right balance of responsiveness and reliability while maintaining loose coupling.

### Q11: DataBase
Database Locks
While debugging performance issues in a relational database system, multiple transactions are frequently waiting for each other, leading to decreased throughput. What phenomenon is this?
Pick ONE option
) Deadlock
O
) Under-provisioning
® Database fragmentation
Replication lag

### A11
The correct answer is: **Deadlock**

Here's why this is the right choice:

1. **Deadlock Definition**:
   - A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions permanently block each other
   - Each transaction waits for a resource held by the other transaction
   - Neither can proceed until the other releases its locks

2. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Circular wait condition (Transaction A waits for B, which waits for A)
   - Transactions remain stuck indefinitely without external intervention
   - Directly causes decreased throughput as transactions can't complete

3. **Why Not Other Options**:
   - **Under-provisioning**: General resource shortage, not specifically about transactions waiting
   - **Database fragmentation**: Affects storage efficiency, not transaction blocking
   - **Replication lag**: Delay in copying data between nodes, not mutual blocking

4. **Deadlock Symptoms**:
   - Transactions stuck in "waiting" state
   - Increasing number of blocked processes
   - Application timeouts
   - Requires database intervention (rollback of one transaction) to resolve

Deadlocks are a common performance issue in relational databases that must be handled through proper transaction design and isolation levels.

/ allocated to the database server to improve search soeed.
() Partition the Books table based on the PublicationDate column

### A12:
The best option to optimize search speed in this scenario is:

**Add a composite index combining both Title and PublicationDate columns**

Here's why this is the optimal solution:

1. **Query Pattern Alignment**:
   - The most frequent operations search by title AND filter by publication date
   - A composite index on (Title, PublicationDate) serves both needs efficiently

2. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Single index can satisfy both search conditions
   - Eliminates full table scans for common queries
   - Better than separate indexes due to index merging overhead

3. **Why Not Other Options**:
   - Full-text search: Overkill for simple title matching (better for content search)
   - Increasing memory: Doesn't address the root cause (missing proper indexes)
   - Partitioning: Helps for date-range queries but not title searches

4. **Implementation Impact**:
   - Minimal application changes required
   - Works with existing queries
   - More storage-efficient than multiple single-column indexes

This composite index will provide the best performance improvement for the described workload while maintaining query flexibility.

The index should be created with:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_title_pubdate ON Books(Title, PublicationDate);
```

### Q13: RestAPI
REST API: Energy Bar
Given a country name, use a chocolate database to find the chocolate
that provides the most energy per gram of chocolate. Use HTTP GET
requests to access the database at https://isonmock.hackerrank.com/
api/chocolates. The query result is paginated and can be further
accessed by appending to the query string &page=(num} where num
is the page number.
To filter the query based on specific fields, append
-fieldname»=value to the URL. For example, https://
jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/chocolates?
countryOfOrigin={country] returns filtered results based on the
country of origin.
The query response from the API includes these fields:
• page: the current page
• per page: the maximum results per page
• total: the total number of records
• total pages: the total number of pages for the query
• data: an array of SON objects containing chocolate information
Each object in the data field includes the following:
• countryOfOrigin: the country where the chocolate originated
• brand the brand name of the chocolate
• O/pesthe type of chocolate
- nutritionalinformation: an object containing nutritional information
about the chocolate
• prices: a price array of different variations of the chocolate
• weights: a weight array of different variations of the chocolate
- other details not relevant to this question
For example, the record from https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/
chocolates indudes the following:"type": "Truffle"
"brand": "Tonv's Chocolonely"
"ingredients": [
"Sugar"
"Cocoa butter"

Given a string country, return the brand and type of chocolate in the
format "brand:type" that provides the most energy per gram
(kcal*0.01 *weight) of chocolate. Round down the energy calculation
to the nearest integer. If a chocolate has multiple weights, use the
average weight rounded down to the nearest integer. If more than
one chocolate provides the same amount of energy, return the one
whose average price rounded down to the nearest integer is the
east.

### A13:
## Python:
I'll help you solve this problem by creating a function that queries a paginated REST API to find the chocolate with the most energy per gram from a specific country.

## Approach
1. **Fetch All Chocolates**: We'll need to handle pagination to get all chocolates from the specified country
2. **Calculate Energy per Gram**: For each chocolate:
   - Compute average weight (rounded down)
   - Calculate energy per gram: `floor(kcal * 0.01 * average_weight)`
3. **Select Best Chocolate**: Find the chocolate with maximum energy per gram, and if there's a tie, choose the one with the lowest average price
4. **Format Result**: Return the result as "brand:type"

## Solution Code
```python
import requests
import math

def energyBar(country):
    base_url = "https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/chocolates"
    max_energy = -1
    best_chocolate = None
    min_price = float('inf')
    
    # Get first page to determine total pages
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}?countryOfOrigin={country}&page=1")
    data = response.json()
    total_pages = data['total_pages']
    
    # Process all pages
    for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
        response = requests.get(f"{base_url}?countryOfOrigin={country}&page={page}")
        data = response.json()
        
        for chocolate in data['data']:
            # Calculate average weight
            weights = chocolate.get('weights', [])
            if not weights:
                continue
            avg_weight = math.floor(sum(weights) / len(weights))
            
            # Calculate energy per gram
            kcal = chocolate['nutritionalInformation']['kcal']
            energy = math.floor(kcal * 0.01 * avg_weight)
            
            # Calculate average price
            prices = chocolate.get('prices', [])
            avg_price = math.floor(sum(prices) / len(prices)) if prices else 0
            
            # Check if this is the best chocolate
            if (energy > max_energy) or \
               (energy == max_energy and avg_price < min_price):
                max_energy = energy
                min_price = avg_price
                best_chocolate = chocolate
    
    if best_chocolate:
        return f"{best_chocolate['brand']}:{best_chocolate['type']}"
    return "No chocolates found"
```

## Explanation
1. **API Pagination Handling**: We first fetch the initial page to determine total pages, then iterate through all pages to process every chocolate from the specified country.

2. **Energy Calculation**:
   - For each chocolate, we calculate the average weight (sum of weights divided by count, rounded down)
   - Energy per gram is computed as `floor(kcal * 0.01 * average_weight)`

3. **Price Calculation**:
   - We calculate the average price (sum of prices divided by count, rounded down)
   - This is used as a tiebreaker when energy values are equal

4. **Selection Logic**:
   - We keep track of the chocolate with highest energy per gram
   - When energies are equal, we select the one with lower average price

5. **Result Formatting**: The final result is returned in "brand:type" format as specified.

This solution efficiently handles the paginated API and implements all the specified requirements for energy calculation and tie-breaking.

## Key Features

1. **Java 8 Streams**: Used for:
   - Calculating averages of weights and prices
   - Finding the chocolate with maximum energy per gram
   - Handling tie-breakers with minimum average price

2. **HTTP Requests**: Uses `HttpURLConnection` to:
   - Make GET requests to the paginated API
   - Handle JSON responses

3. **JSON Processing**: Uses `org.json` library to:
   - Parse API responses
   - Extract chocolate data
   - Handle nested JSON structures

4. **Error Handling**: Includes basic exception handling

5. **Custom Comparator**: Implements proper comparison logic for:
   - Primary sort by energy per gram (descending)
   - Secondary sort by average price (ascending)

This implementation follows all the requirements from the problem statement and handles the paginated API properly while calculating the required metrics.
